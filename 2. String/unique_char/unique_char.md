# Unique Character

As a crewmate, its a test of your observation skills. As soon as you enter the reactor, you witness a string by the manifold and a digital computer containing digits from 0-9. Your task is to find the index of the first element which does not appear more than once in the entire string and provide the index in the digital computer to unlock the manifold.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases T. T test cases follow
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
- The next line contains a string S of length N

## Output

- For each test case, print the index of the first character in the string which appears only once throughout. Indexing starts from 0. If no such character is found then print -1.
