# DSC-NSEC-Algorithms

Welcome to the official repository of DSC NSEC Algorithms, which is one of the projects participating in the Winter of Code 2020.
A project made keeping beginners and aspiring coders in mind who want to start their journey in competitive coding as well as open source.
You may make a pull request for the following issues:-

- Adding code for a program
- Fixing some bug in an already existing code
- New implementation of an algorithm
- Improving comments in existing algorithms

## Project Brief

15 crewmates are on their way to the Space Mission but they are unaware of the fact that there are 3 impostors among them. In order to win, the crewmates
need to be careful of the impostors so that they may not kill them and at the same time keep completing their tasks. The impostors lose as soon as the
tasks are over. As a crewmate, it is your responsibilty to complete all your tasks so that you can save yourself and your fellow crewmates. Each task
involves devising an algorithm which gives the correct output to a given set of input.

## Getting Started

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   OR `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Find a task [here](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/issues)
   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no-body has done so already.
   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.
   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.
5. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
6. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`
7. Commit and push the code to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request `fixes #<issue number>`, replacing **<issue number>** with the number of your issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

## Prerequisites

It is very important to understand the time and space complexity of the algorithms that we devise in order to write an efficient code. Please go through
[this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/) and [this](https://github.com/KevinOfNeu/ebooks/blob/master/Grokking%20Algorithms.pdf) to get a clearer picture of the two.
