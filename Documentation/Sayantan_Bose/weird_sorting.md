Approach used :
I the first iteration while taking the input we are counting the number of 7,14,21 and then in the next iteration we are placing 7 in the array
and decreasing the count of that particular element. Similarly we are placing 14 and decreasing the count of 14 and then 21 and in this way filling up the whole array in O(n) complexity

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
